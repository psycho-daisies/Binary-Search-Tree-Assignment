This program constructs a data structure called Binary Search Tree
that contain Entry objects (a person) with a name, phone number, and address.
A Binary Search tree organizes elements in a tree-like structure.
For each node, the elements in it's left subtree must be less than
and the elements in the right subtree are greater.
A BST is efficient at searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
